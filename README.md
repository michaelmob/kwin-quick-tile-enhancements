# KWin Quick Tile Enhancements
Enhancements for the [KWin](https://userbase.kde.org/KWin) Quick Tile feature.

[KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop)'s window manager [KWin](https://userbase.kde.org/KWin) is chock full of features.
One feature that is not particularly fleshed out is Quick Tiling.
Quick Tiling uses a *keyboard shortcut* or *mouse gesture* to quickly tile
a window to a screen edge or screen corner.

Similar to window snapping in [ChromeOS](https://www.omgchrome.com/hidden-window-snap-resize-feature-chrome-os/), in
[Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk8yTBLEj3c), and in
[GNOME Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj5KjAm-LE).

## Features
1. Mouse friendly.
2. Tiled windows automatically resize together.
3. Smart tile placement.
4. Remembers and restores window sizes when untiled. ([Example](media/untiling-window.webm))
5. Prevent accidental window resize and movement when tiled. ([Example 1](media/prevent-resizing-accident.webm), [Example 2](media/prevent-moving-accident.webm))

## Usage
- Grab and drag a window to an edge or corner of the screen and then drop the window.
- Use a [Quick Tile Global Shortcut](#use-keyboard-shortcuts-to-quick-tile-windows) to tile a window to a screen edge or screen corner.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
All useful keyboard shortcuts to this script are located in the
*KWin* section of *Global Shortcuts* inside of the *System Settings*.
The easiest way to open this window is through [Kickoff (Application Launcher)](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Kickoff) or
[Krunner](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner). Search for and open **`Global Shortcuts`**.

#### Use keyboard shortcuts to Quick Tile Windows
Set the shortcuts with the actions: `Quick Tile Window to the (...)`<br/>
Default shortcuts are: `Meta+{Up,Down,Left,Right}` which tile to each respective
screen edge.<br/>
Corner quick tile shortcuts must be set manually.

#### Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between windows
Set the shortcuts with the actions: `Switch to Window (to the ...)`<br/>
Default shortcuts are: `Meta+Alt+{Up,Down,Left,Right}`<br/>
Setting Vim keys (`Meta+{H,J,K,L}`) is recommended.

## Warnings
- Multi-monitor support not tested.
